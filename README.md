Factorial and Fibonacci Calculator

  Description
This repository contains two C++ programs: one for calculating the factorial of a non-negative integer and another for calculating the nth Fibonacci number. Both programs measure the runtime of their respective calculations.

  How to Run the Programs
 Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g. g++).
 Clone this repository.
 Open a terminal or command prompt.
 Navigate to the directory where the source files are located.
 Compile the programs using the following commands:
   g++ factorial.cpp -o factorial
   g++ fibonacci.cpp -o fibonacci
 Run the programs using the following commands:
  ./factorial
  ./fibonacci 

  The output
Enter a non-negative integer for factorial: 6
The factorial of 6 is: 720
Runtime for factorial calculation: 0.0000004 seconds

Enter a non-negative integer for Fibonacci: 6
The 6th Fibonacci number is: 8
Runtime for Fibonacci calculation: 0.0000004 seconds
