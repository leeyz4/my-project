# Factorial and Fibonacci Calculator

 ## Description
  
This repository contains two C++ programs: one for calculating the factorial of a non-negative integer and another for calculating the nth Fibonacci number. Both programs measure the runtime of their respective calculations.

 ## How to Run the Programs
  
 Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g. g++).
 
 Clone this repository.
 
 Open a terminal or command prompt.
 
 Navigate to the directory where the source files are located.
 
 ## Compilation
 To compile the program, use the following command
 ```bash
g++ factorial.cpp -o factorial
g++ fibonacci.cpp -o fibonacci
```
## Usage
To Run the factorial program:
 ```bash
./factorial
```
Enter a number when prompted.
e.g(Enter a non-negative integer for factorial: 6
The factorial of 6 is: 720
Runtime for factorial calculation: 0.0000004 seconds)

To Run the fibonacci  program:
 ```bash
./fibonacci 
```
computes for the nth number
e.g(Enter a non-negative integer for Fibonacci: 6
The 6th Fibonacci number is: 8
 Runtime for Fibonacci calculation: 0.0000004 seconds)
